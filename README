A homework assignment from my Advnced Programming course.
Written in C, the program takes two text files, one empty and
one with text, and it reverses the text of one file and copies 
the result to another file.

Implemented using a hardcoded buffer size and file names.
Includes sample text files.

Can be used for reference.
